# Spring Boot 3 Thymeleaf Real-Time Web Application
## Overview
This project is a real-time web application developed as part of the Spring Boot 3 Thymeleaf course from Udemy. The application showcases various features of Spring Boot and Thymeleaf, providing dynamic web page generation and user authentication.

## Key Learnings
During the course, I gained proficiency in using Thymeleaf, a powerful HTML template engine, for dynamically generating web pages. I also learned about the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern, which helps structure web applications efficiently. Some of the key learnings include:

- Implementing login forms and using Spring Security for user authentication.
- Managing user permissions and controlling access to specific controller endpoints.
- Utilizing Spring JPA and Hibernate for smooth interactions with databases.
- Familiarizing myself with Maven for effective project dependency management.

## Project Highlights
The BlogApp project, developed during the course, stands as a testament to my newfound skills in Spring Boot and Thymeleaf. Some of its highlights include:

- User-friendly blog application interface using Bootstrap CSS and Thymeleaf MVC.
- Implementation of two roles, ROLE_ADMIN and ROLE_GUEST, to manage posts and comments.
- Configuring a Many-to-Many relationship between USERS and ROLES using a joining table (user_roles).
- Establishing a one-to-many relationship between posts and comments for user interaction.
- Integration of CKEditor 5 for multimedia-rich content creation.
- Utilization of @Validation for form handling, ensuring data input adheres to specified rules and constraints for a more robust and secure application.
- Enabling secure user authentication and authorization using Spring Security, granting access to specific endpoints based on user roles.
